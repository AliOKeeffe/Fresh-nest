# Fixed Bugs

## Update bag quantity

I wanted the bag subtotal to automatically update when the product quantity was changed rather than clicking an 'update' link. To do this I wrote an AJAX Post method to request the 'adjust bag' url and populate it with the updated quantity and item id and reload the page. 

When I first attempted to do this I put a click listener on the + and - buttons so the page would automatically update when these were clicked. However I quickly ran into issues due to the fact that there was already a click listener on those buttons (which updates the quantity in the box). After some research I discovered that this issue is called a race condition "an undesirable situation that occurs when a device or system attempts to perform two or more operations at the same time".

In order to solve this problem I removed the click listener which updated the bag total and instead created a new function 'Update Bag' which is called when the +/- is clicked (but after the quantity box is updated). Two parameters are passed into the function (quantity and item ID) and the AJAX method within the function uses these parameters to update the bag total. 

## Deployment

When I initially attempted to deploy to Heroku the build would fail with the error message "Could not build wheels for backports.zoneinfo". This was due to the fact that Heroku by default uses python version 3.10 which isn't compatible with backports.zoneinfo. In order to fix this I had to create a runtime.txt to specify the Python version for Heroku to install (python-3.8.13). However the next time I tried to deploy I got a further error "Requested runtime 'python-3.8.13' is not available for this stack (heroku-22)". After some research I realised that in order to use this version of Python I would have to use heroku-20 instead of heroku-22. I was able to downgrade the heroku version using the command `heroku stack:set heroku-20 -a app name` which resolved the issue and I was able to deploy the site.
